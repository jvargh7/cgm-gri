## Abstract
### Background: 
The Glycemia Risk Index (GRI) was recently proposed as a composite measure of dysglycemia based on clinician review of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) tracings. The prognostic utility of the GRI, which considers the quality of dysglycemia by weighting time spent in hypo- and hyperglycemic ranges, is unknown.    
### Methods: 
Using continuous glucose monitoring data from 5,901 patients of a tertiary care diabetes specialty center in Chennai, India, we studied the association of GRI defined as the sum of Low GRI [ (3 x % below 54 mg/dL) + (2.4 x % 54-less than 70 mg/dL)] and High GRI [(1.6 x % above 250 mg/dL) + (0.8 x %  greater than 180-250 mg/dL)] with prevalent complications in a training dataset after adjusting for HbA1c (%), age at onset (years), duration (years), BMI (kg/m2) and sex. We assessed the predictive utility of GRI, relative to time outside range (% readings; <70 or >180 mg/dL) and time outside range along with high CV (coefficient of variation > 0.36). We defined cutoffs for the LGRI (high/low), and HGRI (high/low) using clinical targets for standardized metrics, and developed four dysglycemia profiles to study their association with complications.    
### Results: 
A 10- unit increase in GRI score (worse glycemic control) was associated (prevalence odds ratio) with higher odds of retinopathy (NPR: 1.05 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.08), PDR: 1.08 (95%CI: 1.00, 1.17)), nephropathy (microalbuminuria: 1.05 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.08), macroalbuminuria: 1.10 (95%CI: 1.06, 1.14), and DKD (1.10, 95%CI: 1.05, 1.15). In predicting complications, the GRI model was comparable to TIR and a model with TIR and high CV. Profiles with either high LGRI or high HGRI had higher prevalence odds of all complications, relative to low LGRI and low HGRI.    
### Conclusions: 
Glycemia Risk Index is a useful measure in predicting prevalent complications.
